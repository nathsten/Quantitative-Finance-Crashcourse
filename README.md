- Make sure to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. 

- Make yourself familiar with using jupyter notebook:

    Recomend wathcing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS5ZXOC4e6A&ab_channel=TheCodeCity) intro if you are unfamiliar


## Plan for the course.

- Introduction to important terms in quantiative finance

- Price models. 

    We will dive deeper into multiple ways to model price movents of stocks using various SDEs, and autoregressive models. 

    We will then use these price models to analyse the risk exposure of a stock.

- Portfolio optimization.

    We will here build on these price models in a portfolio perspective to find optimal fits to the given market conditions using MC simulations. 

- Option pricing.

    Using various SDEs combined with the Black-Scholes formula we will learn how to price derivativs like options using MC simulations and the closed form solution to BS.

    We will also take a look into using various call-options to create a hedging portfolio to hedge against directional risk as well as volatility risk. 

    Use stock spesific models to perform informed simulations on a portfolio. 

- Benchmark regression. 

    - Using OLS we will look at how to use regression on indicators to make a benchmark model of which signals to look for in a risk adjusted portfolio.
